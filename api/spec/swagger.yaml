    Pi-Hole Local DNS / DHCP management external API

    This project provides a RESTful API to manage some of the DHCP/DNS resources on a pi-hole installation, like:

      - Manage static DHCP entries
      - Manage local DNS entries
      - Manage CNAME aliases

    We are not interested on managing the Adlists, Whitelists, Query logs or any other primary functionality of the pi-hole or the FTL.
